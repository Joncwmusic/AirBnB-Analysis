Goal: So the goal of this is to compare real estate data with air bnb data. Ideally, the question I want to answer is:
"Is it worth it to buy a house to run a full time airbnb?"

So far I've collected the data and done a few visualizations for exploratory analysis.
Nothing so far is too surprising although some crazy outliers are messing with the visualization so I may need to go back and clean some of those out just to make things look just a bit nicer.
